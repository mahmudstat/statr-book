The term has got three different meanings. Plural of the term statistic , which refers to any function of sample values, for example, \\(\\bar x = \\frac {\\sum_i^n x_i} n\\) Table of values Table 1.1: A Subset from Iris Data Set Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa Technique of dealing with data Collection Organization Analysis (such as regression analysis) Interpretation Presentation 1.1.2 Statistics vs Data Science Statistics deals mainly with analyzing and interpreting data, while data science deals more with predictive analytics. (more) 1.1.3 Statistics vs Mathematics Consider the following equations \\(Y = X + 0.2 \\times X\\) Say, \\(X\\) = Basic Salary of an employee in a company, while \\(Y\\) is computed from \\(X\\), with adding to \\(X\\) 20% of \\(X\\). In this scenario, given the values of \\(X\\), we can always tell what the gross salary would be. What if we have an equation such as the following: \\(Y = X + 0.1 \\times R\\) Where, \\(R\\) is the revenue the company earns through the employee. In this case, the salary of the employee would vary in each month. The salaries from month to month would unpredictably vary, which is where statistics comes in. Statistics deals with randomness, situations where we cannot exactly tell which outcome we might get. We may (or may not) know the possible outcomes (like when tossing a coin, we know the possible outcome, but which will happen) 1.1.4 Other Statistical Concepts They will be briefly explained later when the relevant R codes are mentioned. They include various charts, concepts of central tendency and dispersion, correlation, regression, test of hypothesis, among others. 1.2 Introdcution to R 1.2.1 Why R? R is the most popular programming language for statistical analysis, second most popular for machine learning. Reasons at a glance Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Big Community Made by statisticians for statisticians Easy to use codes Stunning graphics, esp. with ggplot2 Reproducibility Runs on a wide array of platforms, including but not limited to Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. 1.2.2 Who Use R? R is both used in academia and industry. Good analyses for theses are now accomplished using R. Industries heavily rely on R for statistical analysis, predictive analytics, and machine learning. Some of the renowned companies using R are: Google (effective advertising and forecasting) Facebook (behavioral analysis) Twitter (sensitivity analysis) Microsoft Uber Airbnb IBM ANZ HP Ford 1.2.3 Who Developed R? R was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (statistician from New Zealand and Canada, respectively). 1.2.4 Other Languages and Packages Some other languages for data analysis are: Python Julia Java Scala Packages SPSS STATA Eviews 1.2.5 Installing R and Rstudio Go to Cran1 1.2.6 Start Writing R Code (Windows, Linux, and Command Line) Using R Console directly: write code and press enter (NOT a good method) Using Rstudio Console: Equivalent to using R console Using R Script from Rstudio: to run, press Ctrl + Enter It is best to use Rstudio. 1.2.7 Effectively Using Rstudio Keep things organized Make a project Put all codes, data, and output inside that project directory. Use View function to view data tables, for example View(iris), which displays the iris data set. 1.2.8 R Script An R script is a convenient tool to organize a work. A project may consist of several or many such scripts. They can be easily shared with others. An R script has the extension .R or .r. Tips Use line gaps often to separate code segments Add comments explaining codes, so others (including future you) can understand what they mean. 1.2.8.1 Quoting R codes from another R file. source('r_file.R') Thus, you can use functions, data, variables etc. defined or saved elsewhere. 1.2.9 R Documentation (Help) To get help, type ?keyword or help(keyword) For example, ?mean would show options and examples for the mean function. 1.2.10 Handling Error If the code is not run, and shows a + sign, it means the code is not complete yet; complete it or press esc to start over. If the error message shows could not find function ..., correct the function name. If you do not understand the error message, copy and paste it to your browser search bar, and see what help the community has to offer. 1.2.11 R Packages R packages are extensions of base R, providing some very useful tasks. Many R packages made R more popular and useful, such as ggplot2, karet, and rmarkdown. To install a package, run install.packages(\"package_name\"), for example install.packages(\"tidyverse\") installs the package tidyverse. When installing, the package name must be enclosed within quotation marks (\" \"). Before being able to make use of a package, one must load the package, by running library(package_name), for example, to load ggplot2, run library(ggplot2), this time without quotation marks (\" \"). 1.2.12 R Mathematical Operations Make a table: Purpose, code, example, output 1.2.12.1 Arithmetic Operators Purpose Operator Example Output Addition + 2+3 5 Subtraction - 10-9 1 Multiplication * 10*8 80 Division / 10/5 2 Exponent ^ or ** 10^2 100 Modulus (Remainder) %% 10%%4 2 Integer Division %/% 12%/%5 2 1.2.12.2 Relational Operators Purpose Operator Example Output Less than &lt; 2&lt;3 5 Greater than &gt; 10&gt;11 1 Less than or equal to &lt;= 10&lt;=8 80 Greater than or equal to &gt;= 10&gt;=5 2 Equal to == 10^2==100 100 Not equal to != 100!=99 2 1.2.12.3 Logical Operators 1.2.12.4 Mathematical Functions 1.2.13 Assigning Values Variables make it easy to assign values and use them later. To assign values to variables, you can use either = or &lt;-, but in R, &lt;- is preferred. In Rstudio, pressing alt + - is a very good shortcut for correctly typing &lt;-. Comments start with hash (#) Example x &lt;- 3 y &lt;- 4 x+y ## [1] 7 x*y ## [1] 12 x+10-y ## [1] 9 x^y ## [1] 81 x**y ## [1] 81 log(x) ## [1] 1.098612 round(log(x), 3) ## [1] 1.099 1.2.13.1 Round, Floor, and Ceiling Suppose, we have a number 3.9856 round rounds the number; x &lt;- 3.9856 round(x,3) # (up to 3 digits) ## [1] 3.986 celing switches the number to the next integer; ceiling(x) ## [1] 4 floor gives the previous integer. floor(x) ## [1] 3 celing and floor always give integer output. 1.2.14 Generating Multiple Numbers x &lt;- 1:10 x ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 seq(1,20, 2) # Keeping fixed gap between the numbers ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 seq(1,50, length.out = 5) # Generating specific amount of numbers. ## [1] 1.00 13.25 25.50 37.75 50.00 1.2.15 Data Types Logical Numeric integer Double Character 1.2.16 Learn More Stat Mania artciles and link to contents Books Coursera, Edx, and other MOOCs. 1.2.17 Vector A vector is set of similar items. In Linear Algebra, it is defined as a matrix with only one column or one row. It could contain numbers of different types, strings, or logical values. A vector makes it easy to simultaneously operate on multiple items. We make a vector when we are dealing with only one variable. A vector can contain only one type of values, such ac numeric, logical etc. A vector in R is usually made using c, which stands for concatenate. A vector can also be made using seq command shown earlier, or by using a colon (:) sign, if the values are successive integers. x &lt;- c(4, 5, 7) a &lt;- 10:12 y &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;) z &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) 1.2.17.1 Adding Vectors If a scalar (a single value) is added to a vector, it would be added to values. If two (or more) vectors with equal lengths are added together, corresponding values would be added; the same goes for almost any other mathematical operation (such as subtraction or division). If, however, the lengths are unequal, the values of the smaller vector would be repeated from the beginning. x + 3 # Adds 3 all values of x. ## [1] 7 8 10 x + a # Corresponding values are added. ## [1] 14 16 19 b &lt;- 6:7 x + b # Values of b are repeated. ## Warning in x + b: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object ## length ## [1] 10 12 13 1.2.17.2 Indexing Vectors Using []: x ## [1] 4 5 7 x[2] # Extracts the second value. ## [1] 5 x[2:3] # Extracts second through third values. ## [1] 5 7 x[c(1,3)] # Extracts the first and third values. ## [1] 4 7 x[-1] # Extracts all except the first value. ## [1] 5 7 x[-c(1,3)] # Extracts all except the first and third values. ## [1] 5 Using Logical x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)] # Extracts the first and second values. ## [1] 4 5 y ## [1] &quot;red&quot; &quot;green&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;black&quot; &quot;orange&quot; z ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE y[z] # Using variables already stored.

Although it has more than two rows and columns, it can only contain items of a single type. Contents from Jafar Sir 1.2.19 Data Frame A Data frame contains many variables; each variable can be different type. Distinct variables are placed in columns and values/observations are in rows.

Length of each variable must be equal. df &lt;- data.frame(x=c(10, 12, 15), y=c(&quot;Dhaka&quot;, &quot;Cumilla&quot;, &quot;Rajshahi&quot;), w=sample(100, 3), v=20:22) 1.2.19.2 Indexing A Data Frame Methods used for matrices apply.
